- Combinational Logic (Ability to perform an operation)
	- Uses basic gates
	- Used for data operations
	- Time is not a parameter
- Sequential Logic (Ability to control an operation)
	- Allows for controls and flow branching
	- Used to implement memory
	- Time is a parameter
- The purpose is to design and build architectures that are
	1. Reliable secure and safe
	2. Energy efficient
	3. Predictable and low latency
	4. Specialized for key industries and domains (AI/ML, Genomics, VR, etc)
- Evaluation Criteria for the Design (BALANCE)
	- Functionality
	- Reliability
	- Space Requirements
	- Cost
	- Expandibility
	- Comfort Level
	- Security
	- Others

### Basic Concepts

- **Analog** means continuous. It expresses the smooth gradual change of parameters
- **Digital** means to operate using parameters that have limited discrete values. These parameters change by jumping from one allowed value to another
- Easier to work with digital, conversion from analog to digital is common, this process is called digitization
- Lossless digitization is not possible
- Number Representation
- Positional Number System (examples decimal, octal, binary, etc.)
