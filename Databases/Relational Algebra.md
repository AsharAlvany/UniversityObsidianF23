Unary Relational Operations
- SELECT $\sigma$
	- Select returns a set of tuples based on a condition.
	- The Boolean expression like in an if-statement
- PROJECT $\pi$
	- The project operation removes any duplicate tuples
	- Project returns only the requested attributes of the matching tuples.
- RENAME $\rho$
	- Rename assigns a new name to an attribute in the relational algebra
- UNION $\cup$
	- Union operations may only be performed on sets that are "type compatible" which means that all the data types of the first table must match the data types of the second table
- INTERSECTION $\cap$
	- Union operations may only be performed on sets that are "type compatible" which means that all the data types of the first table must match the data types of the second table
- DIFFERENCE $-$
	- The result of R â€“ S, is a relation that includes all tuples that are in R but not in S (MUST ALSO BE TYPE COMPATIBLE)
- CARTESIAN PRODUCT $X$
	- All of one table mixed with all of another table to make a new table of size table one times table two
- JOIN $\bowtie$ 
	- The sequence of CARTESIAN PROJECTr followed by SELECT is used quite commonly to identify and select related tuples from two relations
	- This operation is very important for any relational database with more than a single relation, because it allows us combine related tuples from various relations
 - DIVISION $\divsymbol$
	 - For a tuple t to appear in the result T of the DIVISION, the values in t must appear in R in combination with every tuple in S.
	 - Dividing a table by a list of attributes, will return the elements within the table that match both of the attributes within the list
