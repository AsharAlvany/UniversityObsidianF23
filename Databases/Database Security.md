Threats to Databases
- Loss of integrity - is the correct information being stored and retrieved. If not, the database is a waste
- Loss of availability - Denial of service, or other loss of access to needed information to complete tasks
- Loss of confidentiality - If the information is not kept private, then events such as public embarrassment, legal action, or loss of trust can result

- From a sensitive source - criminal investigations
- Declared sensitive - user defined sensitivity
- Contains a sensitive attribute or record - a table that has an SSN for a key is more sensitive than a tuple that has NetID as a key
- Sensitive in relation to previously disclosed data - When joined with another table, the information becomes sensitive
**Database Administration**
- Data availability - concurrency control allows only the correct user  to update a data record
- Access Acceptability - only users with proper authorization have access
- Authenticity Assurance - user identification, working hours, job type, and need to know
