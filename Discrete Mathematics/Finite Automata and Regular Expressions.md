Finite Automata are the simplest model of computation: computation is very limites, yet very useful in many different areas including compiler construction, switching theory, biology, communication protocols...

Define set of states, inputs, transitions of states based on states.

*What is an initial state?
What are accept/final states?
What are input sequences leading from init to an accept state?*

The state and input relationship is represented by diagrams and transition tables

	Where {0,1} are the inputs and $\{q_1, q_2, q_3\}$ are the states

	The double circle is the desired final state
