An **alphabet $\Sigma$** is a finite set of **symbols**
A **string** over $\Sigma$ is a finite sequence of symbols from $\Sigma$
The **length** of a string w over $\Sigma$ is the number of occurrences of symbols. Notation |w|
For $a\epsilon \Sigma$  $|w|_a$  denotes the number of occurrences of a in w also denoted by $\#_a$.
The **empty string** is of length zero and is denoted by $\lambda$ or $\epsilon$
**Lexicographic ordering** of strings:
- Shorter strings precede longer ones
- Strings of same length are ordered according to dictionary ordering (assuming a total order of $\Sigma$)
-
