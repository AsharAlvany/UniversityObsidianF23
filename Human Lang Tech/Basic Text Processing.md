	- A <u>morpheme</u> is a minimal meaning-bearing unit in language and there are two classes of morphemes: stems and affixes
	- <u>Stems</u> are the main morphemes in word
	-  <u>Affixes</u> add additional meaning to the stem to modify their meanings/grammatical functions
	- Prefixes, suffixes, infixes, and circumfixes are all examples of affixes
