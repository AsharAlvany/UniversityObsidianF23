<u>Regular expression</u> is an algebraic notation for characterizing a set of strings
- REs are particularly useful for searching in texts
- \[\] is used for a possible range of values
- ^ the carat is for not also for asserting the beginning of the string
- \\w matches one or more word characters
- | is used for or
- ? is used for making the character before the symbol to be optional
- . is used for specifying any character
- \* used for 0 or more of the previous character
- + one or more of the previous character
- \\b is used for beginning/end of word
- Examples:
	- Searching for dates: "\\b\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{4}"
	- DD/MM/YYYY
	- Searching for email addresses: "^\\w+(\[.-]?\\w+)\*@\\w+(\[.-]?\\w+)\*(.\\w\[2,3])+$"

- Reducing false positives and false negatives involves increasing accuracy or precision and coverage or recall, respectively
- A token is a set of characters separated by delimiters
- <u>Morphology</u> is the study of the way words are built from smaller units called morphemes
	- A <u>morpheme</u> is a minimal meaning-bearing unit in language and there are two classes of morphemes: stems and affixes
	- <u>Stems</u> are the main morphemes in word
	- <u>Affixes</u> add additional meaning to the stem to modify their meanings/grammatical functions
	- Prefixes, suffixes, infixes, and circumfixes are all examples of affixes
	- <u>Inflectional morphology</u> - is the combination of a word stem with a grammatical morpheme usually resulting in a word of the same class (girl -> girls)
	- <u>Derivational morphology</u> - is the combination of word stem with a grammatrcal morpheme usually resulting in a word of a different class (common -> uncommon)
	- <u>Morphological Parsing</u> - taking an input and producing a structure for it. Morphological parsing takes as an input words and produces a structure that reveals its morphological features![[Pasted image 20240124151016.png]]
