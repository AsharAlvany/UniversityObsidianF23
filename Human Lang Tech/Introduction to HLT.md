**Human Language Technology** - concerned with the computational techniques used for processing human language. It creates and implements computer models for the purpose of performing various natural language tasks
- Tasks:
	- <u>Mundane applications</u> - word counting, spell checking, automatic hyphenation
	- <u>Cutting edge applications</u> - automated question answering bots, building NL interfaces to databases, machine translation
- Natural Language Processing is the core of HLT
- NLP multidisciplinary nature:
	- Linguistics - how words, phrases, and sentences are formed
	- Psycholinguistics - How people understand and communicate using human language
	- Cognitive Modeling - deals with models and computational aspects of NL
	- Philosophy- relates to the semantics of language; the notion of meaning and how words identify objects
	- Computer Science - model formilation and implementation using modern methods
	- Artificial intelligence - issues related to knowledge representation and reasoning
	- Statistics - many NLP problems are modeled using probabilistic models
	- Machine Learning - automatic learning of rules and procedures based on lexical, syntactic, and semantic features
	- NL Engineering - implementation of large, realistic systems.
- Applications of NLP
	- Text-based applications
		- Finding documents on certain topics
		- Question Answering
		- Knowledge acquisition
	- Dialogue - based applications
		- Conversational Agents
		- Tutoring systems
		- Problem solving
- Basic levels of language processing
	- Phonetic - how  words are related to the sounds that realize them. Essential for speech processing.
	- Morphological Knowledge - how words are constructed (friend, friendly, unfriendly, friendliness)
	- Syntactic Knowledge - how words can be put tofether to form correct sentences and the role each word plays in the sentence
	- Semantic Knowledge - words and sentence meaning
	- Pragmatic knowledge - how sentences are used in different situations. Think contextual knowledge.
	- Discourse Knowledge - how the meaning of words and sentences is effected by the proceeding sentences; pronoun resolution
	- World Knowledge - the vast amount of knowledge necessary to understand texts.
	- Language Generation - have the machine generate coherent text or speech
