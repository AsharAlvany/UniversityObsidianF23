Cloud Computing offers usually at least the following, so the user does not need to upkeep their own systems: computer power and storage
**Shared Responsibility Model** - responsibilities are split between the different components that are involved in a system
**Cloud Service Type** - determines the components of the shared responsibilities model. The following are the examples oif different Cloud Service Types
- Infrastructure as a Service
	- Service Provider responsibilities: physical datacenter, physical network, physical hosts
	- Service Consumer: operating system, network controls, applications, identity and directory infrastructure, accounts and identities, devices, information and data
- Platform as a Service
	- Service Provider responsibilities: physical datacenter, physical network, physical hosts, operating system, network controls, applications, identity and directory infrastructure
	- Service Consumer: network controls, applications, identity and directory infrastructure, accounts and identities, devices, information and data
- Software as a Service
	- Service Provider responsibilities: physical datacenter, physical network, physical hosts, operating system, network controls, applications, identity and directory infrastructure
	- Service Consumer: identity and directory infrastructure, accounts and identities, devices, information and data
The service consumer will always be responsible for:
- Accounts and identities, devices, information and data
The cloud provider is always responsible for:
- The physical data center, network, and hosts
The service model determines the responsibilities for:
- OS, network controls, applications, identity and infrastructure
**Cloud Models** - define the deployment type of cloud resources
- Private Cloud - a cloud used by a single identity/corporation. Comes with greater control, as well as more cost. An example could be a dedicated data center offsite, potentially even a third party that has a dedicated data center for the entity
- Public Cloud - built, controlled, and maintained by a third-party cloud provider. Anyone that wants to purchase cloud services can access and use resources.
- Hybrid Cloud - a computing environment that uses both public and private clouds in an inter-connected environment. Control over the extent of security for different types of information, provide a backup to a private cloud if there is a surge of needed storage or processing power required.
- Multi-Cloud - dealing with two or more public cloud providers and manage resource and security in both environments. Migrating providers, prefer the use of different services of different cloud providers.
- Azure Arc - a set of technologies that helps with management of your cloud environment
- Azure VMWare Solution - run VMWare workloads in Azure with seamless integration and scalability
Two types of expenses in IT infrastructure models:
- **Capital Expenditure** - a one-time, up-front expenditure to purchase or secure tangible resources. A new building, building a datacenter, etc.
- **Operational Expenditure** - is spending money on services or products over time. Renting a convention center, signing up for cloud services, etc.
The operational expenditure aspect of cloud-based models allows entities to better keep up with demand and adjust accordingly. When met with new demand, simply add more virtual machines, when met with an abundance of resources, remove virtual machines. Pay as you go pricing model.
