1. First ask "What is my problem?"
	- Create a set of precise specifications of the problem. What is the algorithm supposed to solve
2. A precise description of the algorithm itself (create psuedocode)
3. A proof that the algorithm solves the problem outlined in step 1
4. How fast or space efficient does the algorithm need to be?
