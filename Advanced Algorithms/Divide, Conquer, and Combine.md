The technique of taking a problem and splitting it into sub-problems, solving the sub-problems, and then combining the solutions to create a general solution in a recursive nature is known as **Divide, Conquer, and Combine**

#### Analyzing
1. How many recursive calls are there in the algorithm?
2. What are the problem sizes of each recursive call?
3. How much time is spent on dividing?
4. How much time is spent combining the problem?
