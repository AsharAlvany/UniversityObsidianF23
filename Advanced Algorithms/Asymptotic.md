$\Theta$ think of upper and bottom bounding by some constant. So f(n) = $\Theta$(g(n)) if there exists some constants $c_1$ and $c_2$ such that $c_1\cdot g(n) \leq f(n) \leq c_2\cdot g(n)$ 
O is defined to be used when assigning Asymptotic Upper Bounds 
$\Omega$ is defined to be used when assigning Asymptotic Lower Bounds

f(n) = o(g(n)) :  a $\lt$ b : means that g(n) GROWS FASTER
f(n) = $\omega$(g(n)) : a $\gt$ b : means that f(n) GROWS FASTER
f(n) = O(g(n)) : a $\leq$ b : f is NO WORSE THAN g
f(n) = $\Omega$(g(n)) : a $\geq$ b : g is NO WORSE THAN f
