**Machine learning**
- a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building
- using algorithms that iteratively learn from data, machine learning allows computers to find hidden insights without being explicitly programmed
Machine Learning is composed of three portions
* Statistics
* Domain
* Computer Science
**Data Science** consists of the three components
- Computer Science
- Math and Statistics
- Domain Knowledge
