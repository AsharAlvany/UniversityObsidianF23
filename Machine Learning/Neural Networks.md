ANN (Artificial Neural Network)
- Architecture: an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer.
- Functionality: suited for regression and classification problems. Image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and more
- Training: involves adjusting the weights based on the error between the predicted output and the actual ouput using techniques such as back propagation
CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
- Architecture: Designed for grid-like data such as images. Consists of convolutional layers, pooling, layers, and fully connected layers. Convolutional layers use filters to capture spatial hierarchies in the data
- Functionality: Object detection, image classification, and image segmentation
- Training: CNNS are trained using back propagation similar to ANNs but with additional considerations for convolutional and pooling layers
