PART A
After watching the film "Conspiracy," it was obvious to see that the Final Solution had already been predetermined by Heydrich and Eichmann. Based on the reactions from the clips shown, there were varying views on the proposed Final Solution. Some were sick to their stomach, as Hofmann. Others believed that the eradication of the Jew was being poorly prioritized over the military movement, such as Krizinger. And others were hesitant to devote a large effort to a matter that should not be the foundation of the Nazi party, such as Buhler. Heydrich kept power during the meeting because he had been appointed directly by Hitler to set the tone for the meeting. Additionally, he threatened his opposition and took a German-first philosophy while delivering his arguments, which led to wider wider support for the proposed Final Solution.
PART B
Chris Abani argues that the world is saved by "gentle, soft, almost invisible acts of compassion." Abani is telling us to be compassionate, to be good to your fellow man. Abani's stories encompassed terrible moments that were brightened by a person being compassionate and selfless. To draw a parallel to Unit 3, there were people that also were responsible for reflecting humanity back at the American public. For example, President Hoover's  assistatnce during World War One where 120,000 Americans were stranded in Europe, Herbert Hoover provided the ships to get the Americans home and Hoover fed 7-8 million people in Belgium also during World War One, all out of his own capital.
PART C
To draw a parallel between the idea of Ubuntu and the people of the COVID-19 pandemic, in my experience, it was teachers that expressed compassion for their students. During the pandemic, I was a high school student going through difficult AP classes that were difficult enough during a normal year, but were intensified due to the lack of a consistent face-to-face classroom medium. My teachers opened their schedules and continued to commit their time to their students even outside of normal school hours, to ensure that the students that they were teaching were adequately prepared for the end of the year tests that we would have to take to acquire the college credit for our courses.
