Rodney King was brutally beaten by the LAPD which led to the LA riots
Race relations and PD relations
People of color are not receiving the justice that they deserve
"Can't we all just get along?" - Rodney King
OJ - even though a black american was on trial for murdering a white woman, but was able to be afforded a fair trial with an unbiased jury (on the basis of color)

My impression of race relations in the 1990s can be succinctly, albeit optimistically, stated as a turning point. The beginning of the 90s were characterized by high tensions with police brutality of people of color, as was shown with Rodney King, and the unwillingness or lack of prioritization to help and protect people of color and their communities during the resulting riots highlighted the broken system of race related decision making. Then came the OJ Simpson case, which became the climax of race relations of the 90s. Although the trial was horrific, the willingness of the courts, judge, and jury to allow a man of color a fair trial with all of the due process that would be afforded a white man showed that the system of race-based discrimination was capable of change.
