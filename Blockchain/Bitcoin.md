<u>Transaction Components</u> - ![[Pasted image 20240207133212.png]]
<u>Forks</u> - a condition that occurs when two different versions of the blockchain exists. The one with a larger amount of PoW is acepted and the other is rejected
- Temporary - two blocks mined at the same time and a tree structure emerges with different branches; longer chain survives
- Soft Fork - rules may change; the nodes following the old rules continue with the old rules and the upgraded nodes following the new rules also accept the old rules
- Hard Fork - hard division between old and new nodes; creates a new cryptocurrency
<u>Block Rewards</u> - miners have to paid when they mine a block
- Originally, there were 50 bitcoins per block mined and this compensation is halved every 4 years
<u>Maturity Rule</u> - to prevent the block mined from becoming non-helpful due to a chain becoming stale, the maturity rule was established where a miner's reward will not be allocated until 100 blocks are mined after the reward block
