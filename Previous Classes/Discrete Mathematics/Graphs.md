A **graph** is a pair G = (V, E) where
* V is a set of vertices and
* E is a set of edges that connects elements of V
A **labeled graph** is a graph whose edges are assigned labels from a finite sets
**Path, degree, simple path (no vertex repeat), cycle (path where the ending and beginning vertices are the same), connected graph ($\forall v, x \epsilon V : vEx$)**
A graph T is a **tree** if T is connected and cycle free. Usually T has a distinguished root
