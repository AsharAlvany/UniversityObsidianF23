*Is there an algorithm to solve a given problem?*
Consider Hilbert's 10th problem:
 >_Given a Diophantine equation with any number of unknown quantities and with rational integral numerical coefficients:_ _To devise a process according to which it can be determined in a finite number of operations whether the equation is solvable in rational integers._

> Input: A [[Diophantine equation]] system, e.g. $P_1 (x_1,...,x_n),...,P_m(x_1,...,x_n) \ \epsilon \  Z [x_1,...,x_n]$
	 Output: yes if ∃ $a_1,...,a_n \ \epsilon \ Z | P_1(a_1,...,a_n) = 0, ... P_m(a_1,...,a_n) = 0$
	 No, otherwise

*Is Hilbert's 10th problem algorithmically solvable?*
No, Hilbert's 10th problem is not arithmetically solvable
