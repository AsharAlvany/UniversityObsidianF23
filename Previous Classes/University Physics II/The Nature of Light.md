Light ray - an imaginary straight line along the direction of travel of the light wave
Wave front - is a surface that joins all adjacent points at which the phase of a wave is the same
Law of Reflection - the angle of incidence on a specular surface is he same as the angle that the reflected ray makes with the normal
Law of Refraction - $$n_a\sin\theta_a=n_b\sin\theta_b$$
If the angle of incidence is larger than the critical angle then the ray cannot pass into the upper material and it will be completely reflected
Critical angle for total internal reflection
$$\sin\theta_{crit} = \frac{n_2}{n_1}$$
	where n1 is the internal
Dispersion is the separation of light colors from white light
In most materials the value of n decreases with increasing wavelength and decreasing frequency.
Wavelength is reduced as a light ray travels through a medium
$$\lambda = \frac{\lambda_0}{n}$$
Polarization is the attribute that a wave's oscillations do have a definite direction relative to the direction of propagation of the wave. The direction of polarization for EM waves are in the direction parallel to the electric field.
The intensity of the transmitted wave is related to the intensity of incident wave by
$$I=I_0\cos^2\theta$$
