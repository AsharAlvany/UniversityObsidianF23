**Electric Flux:** $$\phi_E = \int E\cos\phi dA = \int \overrightarrow{E}\cdot d \overrightarrow{A} = \overrightarrow{E}\cdot\overrightarrow{A}\cos{\phi}$$
	where $d\overrightarrow{A}$ is the vector of the element of the surface area perpendicular to dA
**Gauss's Law:** states that the total electric flux through a closed surface is equal to the total electric charge inside the surface divided by $\epsilon_0$$$\phi_E = \frac{Q_{encl}}{\epsilon_0}$$$$\epsilon_0=8.85\cdot10^{-12}$$
- Gauss's Law is most useful for simplifying problems that have *symmetry* Symmetry can be spherical, cylindrical, or planar
- $\lambda$ is the linear positive charge density and $q_{enc} = \lambda{enc}L$
- $\sigma$ is the surface charge density
- For a *spherical* charge distribution the electric flux is $$E_p4\pi r^2$$
- Gauss is the **generalization** of Coulomb's Law
The electric field at every point *within* a conductor is zero and any excess charge on a solid conductor is located entirely on its surface
The electric field at the surface of any conductor is always perpendicular to the surface and has magnitude $\sigma/\epsilon_0$
**Faraday Cage:** A conducting box in an electric field shields the interior from the field
