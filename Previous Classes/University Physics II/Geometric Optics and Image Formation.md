The relationship between the focal length of a small spherical mirror and its radius is
$$f=\frac{R}{2}$$
Mirror equation - describes the relationship between the focal point and the distance between the vertex of the mirror and the object as well as the distance between the vertex of the mirror and the image
$$\frac{1}f = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}$$
The magnification of a spherical mirror is given by $m = \frac{h_i}{h_o} = -\frac{d_i}{d_o}$
