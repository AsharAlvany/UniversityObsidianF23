Induced Current - when a magnet moves either toward or away a coil there will be a current induced within the coil is called an emf, this can also be caused by a moving secondary coil, a stationary coil with a changing current.
Current is induced in a coil when either the magnetic field, the shape, the location, or the orientation of the coil change.
Magnetic Flux through an area is defined as:
$$\Phi_m = \int_S B \cdot ndA$$
where the integral is a surface integral, and the vector n is a unit vector normal to the differential of surface dA
The net magnetic flux through any close surface is zero (Gauss's Law for Magnetism)
$$\Phi_m=\oint B \cdot ndA = 0$$
where the weber is the unit for magnetic flux
Magnetic flux through a loop is
$$\Phi_M = BA\cos\theta$$
the induced emf (Faraday's Law)
$$\varepsilon = -N\frac{d}{dt}(BA\cos\theta) = NA\cos\theta\frac{dB}{dt}$$
AC Generator or the alternator's induced emf is
$$\varepsilon = -N\frac{d\Phi_M}{dt}=NAB\omega\sin\omega t$$
$$\varepsilon_{max}=NAB\omega$$
where $\omega$ is the angular velocity
$$\omega = 2\pi f$$
Lenz's law states the polarity of the induced emf in a loop is such that it produces a current whose magnetic field opposes the change in magnetic flux through the loop. The current induced by farday's law has a magnetic field that opposes the magnetic field acting upon the circuit.
Motional emf is on induced in a conductor moving through a magnetic field. The electrons in the conductor experience a force that is directed along $l$
$$F_B=qv\cdot B$$
The induced emf of a bar moving through a uniform field
$$\varepsilon = -Blv$$
