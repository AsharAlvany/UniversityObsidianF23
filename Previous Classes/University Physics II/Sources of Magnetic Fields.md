The magnetic field due to an element of a current-carrying wire is given by the **Biot-Savart lav** $$\overrightarrow{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\int\frac{Id\overrightarrow{I}\cdot\hat{r}}{r^2}$$
where dLi s a vector with length dl, in the same direction as the current, and $\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space (also known as the magnetic constant) $$\mu_0 = 4\pi \cdot10^{-7}$$
Magnetic Field due to a thin straight wire $$B=\frac{\mu_0I}{2\pi R}$$
The direction of the magnetic field through a thin straight wire can be found by a different right-hand rule:
- Thumb in direction of current
- Curl your fingers into your palm, the direction that your fingers curl inward is the direction of the magnetic fields
The force per unit length between two long, parallel, current-carrying conductors is given by:
$$\frac{F}{l}=\frac{\mu_0I_1I_2}{2\pi r}$$
The magnetic field at the center of a current loop can be obtained using the Biot-Savart law.
$$B = \frac{\mu_0I}{2R}j$$
Ampere's Law states that the line integral of a magnetic field B along a closed path is proportional to the net current enclosed by the closed path, with the permeability of free space as the proportionality constant:
$$\oint BdI=\mu_0 I$$
