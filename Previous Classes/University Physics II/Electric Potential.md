Electric Potential Energy is shown as
$$W_{a\rightarrow b} = q_0 \int^b_a E\cos\theta dl$$
	where theta is the angle between the electric field and the path differential dl

The change in electric potential energy experienced by a charge $q_0$ in an uniform electric field $E$, as it goes from point $a$ to point $b$ is given by
$$W_{a\rightarrow b} = Fd = q_0Ed$$

The work done on a charge $q_0$ in an uniform electric field caused by a single stationary charge $q$ is given by
$$W_{a\rightarrow b} = kq_0q(\frac{1}{r_a}\frac{1}{r_b})$$

Electric Potential Energy of two point charges $q$ and $q_0$ that are a distance $r$ apart, is defined as:
$$U = k\frac{q_0q}{r}$$
When there are several point charges the electric potential energy is associated with a charge $q_0$ is given by the following algebraic sum:
$$U=kq_0\sum_i\frac{q_i}{r_i}$$
	where $r_i$ is the distance from the charge $q_i$ to charge $q_0$

Electric Potential is defined as:
$$V=\frac{U}{q_0} = \frac{-W_E}{q_0}$$
	The SI symbol is the volt V = J/C

Electric Potential for Continuous Distribution of Charge
$$V=k\int\frac{dq}{r}$$
Potential difference between two points $a$ and $b$ in an electric field $E$
$$V_a - V_b = \int^b_aE\cos\theta dl$$
	Where $V_a -V_b$ is also called the potential of a with respect to b and it's often abbreviated $V_{ab}$ and this difference is called ***Voltage***

Electron Volt is the change in potential electric energy experienced by an electron moving between two point with a potential difference of 1 volt
$$1 eV = 1.602 \cdot10^{-19} J$$
An Equipotential Surface is a three dimensional surface on which the electric potential V is the same at every point. Equipotential Surfaces and Electric Field Lines are always mutually perpendicular.
