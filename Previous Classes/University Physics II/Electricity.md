Four Fundamental Forces
- Gravitational Force
- Weak Nuclear Force
- Electromagnetic Force
- Strong Nuclear Force
The magnitude of charge of the electron or proton is a natural unit of charge, called the fundamental charge e. All observable charge is quantized using this unit: 
	$$e = 1.6022 \cdot 10^{-19}$$
**Electron Mass**
$$m_e=9.109\cdot10^{-31}kg$$
**Proton Mass**
$$m_p=1.673*10^{-27}$$
**Protons** and **electrons** have the same energy (opposite charge)
**Coulomb's Law**
Number of electrons in a Coulomb
$$C=6.24\cdot10^{18}e$$
The magnitude of the electric force between two charges
$$F_{12}=k\frac{|q_1||q_2|}{r^2}$$ where k =  $8.99 \cdot 10^9$ (coulomb's constant) q are the charges, in Coulomb's and r is the distance
**Electric Field**
$$E=\frac{F_0}{q_0}$$
Electric fields are always pointed towards the negative charge and away from the positive electron
