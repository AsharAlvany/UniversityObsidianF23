### Pulled from [[Waves]]: 
**Speed of any periodic wave*** is shown as ==v = λf (m/s)==
The quantity k is called the **wave number**, and is defined as ==k = 2π/λ==
The quantity ω is called the **angular frequency**, and is defined as ==ω = 2πf = 2π/T==
Any wave function satisfies the **wave equation**: ==$$\frac{\delta ^2 y}{\delta x^2} = \frac{\delta^2y}{v^2\delta t^2}$$
==**Simple Harmonic Motion**
$$y(x,t) = A*sin(kx \pm \omega * t + \phi)$$
* With – sign if wave moves toward positive x, and + sign if wave moves toward negative x.
* y is displacement of particle at time t and position x about equilibrium position
* A is the amplitude of the wave
* The quantity k is called the wave number, and is defined as ===k = 2π/λ===  
* The quantity ω is called the angular frequency, and is defined as ===ω = 2πf = 2π/T===
* The quantity Φ is called the initial phase (or phase shift)
**Stretched String** can be characterized by its linear mass density $\mu$ $$\mu = \frac{mass\ of\ string}{length\ of\ string} = \frac{m}{l}$$
**Speed of a stretched string** $$|v| = \sqrt{\frac{F_T}{\mu}}$$
Waves carry energy and the energy carried by a wave on a stretched string is 
$$K_\lambda = \frac{1}{4}\mu A^2\omega ^2\lambda$$
$$U_\lambda = \frac{1}{4}\mu A^2\omega^2\lambda$$
$$E_\lambda = \frac{1}{2}\lambda A^2 \omega^2 \lambda$$
**Wave Intensity** $I=P/A$
**Inverse square-law for intensity**:
$$\frac{I_1}{I_2} = \frac{r^2_2}{r^2_1}$$
**Averaged power of a sinusoidal mechanical wave** $$P_{ave}=\frac{1}{2}\mu A ^2\omega ^2 v$$
