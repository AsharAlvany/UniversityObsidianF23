The OS is responsible for the **virtualization** of resources, which is the taking of physical hardware and transform it into the virtual form of itself to make it easier and more efficient to use.
***WHY?*** This is done because physical hardware can become more than the sum of its parts
***WHAT?*** 
* Virtualization of CPU's can create the illusion of a close to infinite number of CPUs
* Virtualization of memory creates the illusion of private memory pools for addresses
