<u>Infrastructure as Service</u> - You are provisioned app servers to install OS -> Runtimes -> Applications -> and manage data
<u>Platform as Service</u> - Handles serverless, no underlying infrastructure that is able to be interacted with, configured, or paid for. The work that is done by the serverless function that is paid for. Pay for the consumption of CPU cycles, memory amount, etc. Usually event-driven  

What is the Cloud Service Category for the following?
a) I want a messenger service! ==SaaS== (Office365)
b) I want to move these domain controllers! ==IaaS== (full control of OS)
c) Move a web service to Azure! ==PaaS== (only care about the application not really required to have access to underlying infrastructure)
