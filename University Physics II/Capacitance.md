**Capacitor** is any pair of conductors that are separated by an insulator
When a capacitor is charged with +Q in one conductor and -Q in another, ther is a potential difference between the conductors. The ratio Q/V is called the **capacitance** of the capacitor
$$C=\frac{Q}{V_{ab}} = \epsilon_0\frac{A}{d} = 4\pi\epsilon_0\frac{R_1R_2}{R_2-R_1} = \frac{2\pi\epsilon_0L}{Ln(\frac{r_b}{r_a})}$$
	Where the first equation is the general form, the second is when the two parallel conducting plates of area A are separated by a distance d that is small in comparison with their dimensions, the third is a spherical capacitor of two cocenctric conducting shells of radii $R_1$ (inner) and $R_2$ (outer), and the last is the capacitance of two coaxial cylindrical conductors of length L the inner cylinder of radius $r_a$ and the outer cylinder $r_b$  
**Farad** is the SI unit of capacitance which is equal to one Coulomb/Volt

**Series**
The charge is the same, voltage adds, and the equivalent capacitance is less than the individual capacitance
$$Q_T=Q_1=Q_2=...=Q_n \ | \ V_T=V_1+V_2+...+V_n \ | \ \frac{1}{C_T} = \frac{1}{C_1}+\frac{1}{C_2}+...+\frac{1}{C_n} $$
**Parallel**
The charge is added, voltage is the same, and the equivalent capacitance is the sum of the individual capacitance
$$Q_T=Q_1+Q_2+...+Q_n \ | \ V_T=V_1=V_2=...=V_n \ | \ C_T = C_1+{C_2}+...+{C_n} $$
**Potential energy stored in a charged capacitor**
$$U=\frac{Q^2}{2C}=\frac{1}{2}CV^2=\frac{1}{2}QV$$
**Electric Energy Density**
$$u=\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_0E^2$$
A **dielectric** is an **insulator**
If the capacitance of a capacitor with conductors separated by vacuum is C0, then placing a dielectric between the conductors will increase the capacitance to C, by a factor K,
$$C=KC_0$$
which is known that as the **dielectric constant**, but the voltage and the electric field across a capacitor with a dielectric in it decrease by a factor of 1/K
$$V=\frac{V_0}{K} \ | \ E=\frac{E_0}{K}$$
**Permittivity of the dielectric**
$$\epsilon = K\epsilon_0$$
The capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor with a dielectric between the plates can thus be expressed as:
$$C=\epsilon\frac{A}{d}$$
electric energy density in an electric field when a dielectric is present is given by:
$$u=\frac{1}{2}\epsilon E^2$$
