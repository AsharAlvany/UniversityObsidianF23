When a change in current occurs then an emf is induced in all neighboring wires and vice versa. This proportionality constant for this pair of coils is called the mutual inductance
$$\varepsilon_2 = -M \frac{di_1}{dt}$$
$$\varepsilon_1= -M \frac{di_2}{dt}$$
The SI unit of mutual inductance is called the henry
Inductance:
$$L=\frac{N\Phi_B}{i}$$
Potential difference across an inductor
- Same when there is constant current flowing
- Increasing current causes a potential drop
- Decreasing current causes an increase in potential
$$V_{ab} = L\frac{di}{dt}$$
Self-induced emf in an inductor
$$\varepsilon = -L\frac{di}{dt}$$
Energy stored in an inductor
$$U=L\int^I_0idi=\frac{1}{2}LI^2$$
Kirchhoff loop rule
$$\varepsilon - L \frac{dI}{dt}-IR=0$$
