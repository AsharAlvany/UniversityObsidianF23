An electric field in a conductor causes charges to flow creating a *current*
A current *I* is any motion of charge from one region to another
Current is defined as $I = \frac{dQ}{dt}$
The SI unit for current is the Ampere $1A = 1C/s$
**Current Density** is the current per unit cross-sectional area *J* and is given by $$J = \frac{I}{A} = n|q|v_d$$
	where $v_d$ is the drift velocity of the charged particles, n is the concentration of moving charged particles, and q is the charge per particle
**Resistivity** is the ratio of the electric field in the material to the current density it causes $\rho$ is the symbol and the unit is $\Omega \cdot$ m. The *conductivity* is the reciprocal of the resistivity
$$\rho = \frac{E}{J}$$
For **metals**

When voltage is applied to a conductor, producing current I, the ratio of V to I is called the resistance of that particular conductor. The SI unit for resistance is $\Omega$ $$R = \frac{V}{I}$$
The relation between the resistance of a conductor and the resistivity of the material it is made of is
$$R=\frac{\rho L}{A}$$
**Ohmic device** constant R for any voltage

The power delivered to or extracted from a circuit element is given by
$$P = V_{ab}I$$
If the circuit is a resistor the potential difference is $V_{ab}=IR$
