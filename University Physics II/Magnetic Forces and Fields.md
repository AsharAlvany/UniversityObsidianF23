Magnetic Field Lines point away from N poles and toward S poles
Magnetic Field is represented by the symbol $\overrightarrow{B}$, and it is tangent to the magnetic field lines at any point
Opposites attract, like repel
Magnetic fields are caused by the motion of electric charges. currents in a wire produce a magnetic field around the wire.
The magnetic force experienced by a moving electric charge q moving with a velocity $\overrightarrow{v}$ in a magnetic field $\overrightarrow{B}$ is given by:
$$\overrightarrow{F} = q\overrightarrow{v} \cdot \overrightarrow{B}$$
$$F_B=|q|vB\sin\theta$$
The SI unit of B is the Tesla (T)
The right hand rule:
* Palm of hand in direction of magnetic field
* Velocity in direction of outstretched fingers
* Force in direction of thumb
Two charges of equal magnitude but opposite signs moving in the same direction in the same field will experience magnetic forces in opposite directions
Vectors going into the paper are represented by X's and vectors coming out of the paper are represented as dots on the paper
A charged particle in a magnetic field always moves with a constant speed
- If the velocity of the particle is perpendicular to the magnetic field, the particle moves in a circle of radius $R=mv/qB$
	- The period for this circular motion is $T=2\pi m/qB$
- If the particle has velocity components parallel and perpendicular to the field, its path is a helix
	- The speed and thus the kinetic energy of the particle remain constant
Magnetic Force on a current carrying conductor of length l
$$\overrightarrow{F} = I\overrightarrow{l}\cdot\overrightarrow{B}$$
$$F=IlB\sin\theta$$
The net torque on the loop is given by the vector product$$\tau = N\mu \cdot B$$ where N is the number of loops and $\mu$ is given as the magnetic moment to be $$\mu = IA$$
