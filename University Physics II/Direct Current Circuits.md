An **electromotive force** (emf $\varepsilon$), makes current flow. In spite of the name, an emf is not a force, but an energy-per-unit-charge quantity, like potential. Volt is the SI unit of emf
In an ideal emf there is no internal resistance but in a real emf there is some internal resistance which means:
$$V_{ab} = \varepsilon - Ir$$
	Where $V_{ab} = IR$
**Resistors**
- Series: current is the same, total resistance is equal to the sum of all the individual resistances
- Parallel: voltage is the same, total resistance is equal to the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocal of each resistance
The net change in potential energy for a charge q making a round trip around a complete circuit loop must be zero.
**Kirchhoff's Rules**
- A **junction** is a point where three or more conductors meet
	- **Kirchhoff’s junction rule**: The algebraic sum of the currents into any junction is zero: $\sum I = 0$
		- Currents entering the junction are taken as positive, while currents leaving the junction are taken as negative
- A **loop** is any closed conducting path
	- **Kirchhoff’s loop rule**:  The algebraic sum of the potential differences in any loop must equal zero: $\sum V = 0$

**Galvanometer** - measures the current through it
**Ammeter** - measures the current passing through it (ideal ammeter has zero resistance)
**Voltmeter** - measures the potential difference between two points (ideal voltmeter has an infinite resistance)
**Charging a Capacitor**
$$I(t)= I_0e^{-t/RC}$$
	Where initial current $I_0$ is $\varepsilon/R$
**Discharging a Capacitor**
$$I(T)=I_0e^{-t/RC}$$
	Where initial current $I_0$ is $-Q/RC$
$$\uptau = RC$$
