**Sound** is a pressure wave or a displacement wave in a medium
- Assume all sound waves are longitudinal
**Audible Range** of sounds is between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz
**Wave function for sounds as a pressure wave**
$$\Delta P = \Delta P_{max}\sin(kx\mp\omega t + \phi$$
	where $k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$ (the wave number) $\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T}$ (angular frequency) and $\phi$ is the initial phase. Additionally, wave speed is $v = \frac{omega}{k}$ 
Sound waves can also be modeled in terms of the **displacement of air molecules**
$$s(x,t) = s_{max}\cos(kx\mp \omega t + \phi)$$
**Speed of sound** is dependent on the medium
- **Liquid**:$$v=\sqrt{\frac{B}{\rho}}$$
- **Solid rod or bar**:$$v=\sqrt{\frac{Y}{\rho}}$$
- **Ideal Gas:**$$v=\sqrt{\frac{\gamma RT_K}{M}}$$
	- Speed of sound in air at sea level can be approximated as$$v=331\frac{m}{s}\sqrt{\frac{T_K}{273  K}}$$
**Wave Intensity** $$I = \frac{(\Delta p _{max})^2}{2\rho v}$$
**Sound Intensity Level (decibels)** $$\beta(dB) = 10\log_{10}(\frac{I}{I_0})$$
	where $I_0 = 10^{-12}$
**Interference** when two or more waves overlap in the same region of space
- Constructive
- Destructive
**Resonant Wavelength of a tube closed at one end**
$$\lambda_n = \frac{4}{n}L \ \ | \ \ n = 1,3,5,...$$
**Resonant Frequency of a tube closed at one end**
$$f_n=n\frac{v}{4L} \ \ | \ \ n = 1,3,5,...$$
**Resonant Wavelength of a tube open at both ends
$$\lambda_n = \frac{2}{n}L \ \ | \ \ n = 1,2,3,...$$
**Resonant Frequency of a tube open at both ends**
$$f_n=n\frac{v}{2L} \ \ | \ \ n = 1,2,3,...$$
**Beats** are interference between two different frequencies
$$f_{beat} = |f_2 - f_1|{}$$
**Doppler Effect** is an alteration of the observed frequency of a sound due to motion of either the source or the observer. This change in frequency is called **Doppler Shift**
- Frequency is observed to be higher when sounds are approaching you
- Frequency is observed to be lower  when sounds are departing from you
$$f_L = \frac{v + v_L}{v+v_S}f_S$$
